<p>My name is Andrew Trask. I have the privilege of researching Deep Learning Natural Language Processing under the esteemed <a href="https://twitter.com/ptwobrussell">Matthew Russell</a> at <a href="http://digitalreasoning.com/">Digital Reasoning Systems</a>. He guides our work prototyping machine learning systems that not only need to work in the lab, but in scale on some of the world's greatest problems. These include finding terrorists, insider traders, and more recently child-traffickers. </p>
