<p><b>Summary:</b> I learn best with toy code that I can play with. This tutorial teaches how to install Dropout into a neural newtwork in only a few lines of Python code. Those who walk through this tutorial will finish with a working Dropout implementation and be empowered with the intuitions to install it and tune it in any neural network they encounter.</p>
